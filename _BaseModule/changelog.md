## v.1.0.3 Update
### Fixes
- Fixed Backside not render Issue that came up with WE's Update that disabled "RenderBackface" the be on by default 
	- ! **This applies ONLY for new imported layouts, already placed layouts will either have to be reimported or edited. The edit necessary would be 
	to flip the backside 180°**!

### Changes
- Improved some of the Layouts
